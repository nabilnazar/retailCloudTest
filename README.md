Please make sure to add BASE_URL value in order to properly compile

I haven't pushed my constants file containing BASE_URL.

Steps :</n>

   ->Create a new file named Constants under retailCloudTest\app\src\main\java\com\example\retailcloudtest\util

   
   ->Add your base url in this file
    
       {
         object Constants {
         const val BASE_URL = "your base url"
      }
